# 🧠 The Yeatz Identity & Manifesto

> "Stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core purpose—whether in concrete or in code."

## 🌟 The Core Philosophy
1.  **Bold & Raw**: We generally avoid "soft" designs (unless intentional like Healing Journal). We prefer high contrast, strong typography, and Neo-Brutalist aesthetics.
2.  **Functional Minimalism**: No bloat. Every pixel must serve a purpose. If it doesn't help the user achieve their goal, delete it.
3.  **Local-First & Privacy**: We value user data. LocalStorage is our database of choice for simple apps. No forced logins.
4.  **The AI Partnership**: This portfolio is a testament to what a creative mind can achieve with AI assistance. We honor this partnership by documenting our prompts, patterns, and journey. "Code is the bridge between human intent and machine execution."

## 🛤️ The 30 App Challenge
**Goal**: Build and launch 30 High-Quality Apps.
**Current Status**: 2/30 Online.
